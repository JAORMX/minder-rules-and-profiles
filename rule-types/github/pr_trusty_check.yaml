  Verifies that pull requests do not add any dependencies with low Trusty scores

  For every pull request submitted to a repository, this rule will check if the pull request
  adds a new dependency with a low Trusty score. If a dependency with a low
  score is added, the PR will be commented on.
guidance: |
  Ensure that the pull request does not add any dependencies with low Trusty scores.
