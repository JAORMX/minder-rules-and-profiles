  Verifies that a repository has no open security advisories.
guidance: |
  Ensuring that a repository has no open security advisories helps maintain a secure codebase.

  This rule will fail if the repository has unacknowledged security advisories.
  It will also fail if the repository has no security advisories enabled.

  Security advisories that are closed or published are considered to be acknowledged.

  For more information, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories).
